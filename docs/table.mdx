### Sorting

The `Table` component supports sorting by column. To enable sorting, set the
`sortDescriptor` prop to an object with the following properties: `column` and
`direction`. The `column` property is the column to sort by, and the `direction`
property is the direction to sort in. The `column` property should be the column
key, and the `direction` property should be either `"ascending"` or
`"descending"`.
