### Content

Buttons can contain a label, icon, or both. Use icons by passing an icon
component as a child. If the only child is an SVG element, the button will be
sized to a square. This can be controlled manually by setting the `isSquare`
prop.

<Note>
  If a visible label isn't specified, an `aria-label` must be provided for
  accessibility.
