### Controlled open state

The above example wraps the Dialog in a `<DialogTrigger>` component, which
handles opening. To control the open state of the Dialog programmatically, use
`isOpen` and `onOpenChange` props.

<Demo demo={<DialogDemo.Controlled />} code={demos.controlled} />

### Accessing uncontrolled state

To programmatically close an uncontrolled dialog, wrap the children into a
function that receives a `close` function as a parameter. This function can be
called to close the dialog.

<Demo demo={<DialogDemo.Close />} code={demos.close} />
