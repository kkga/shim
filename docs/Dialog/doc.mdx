<Demo
  title="Controlled open state"
  demo={<DialogDemo.Controlled />}
  code={demos.controlled}
>
  The example above wraps the Dialog in a `<DialogTrigger>` component, which
  handles opening. To control the open state of the Dialog programmatically, use
  `isOpen` and `onOpenChange` props.
</Demo>

<Demo
  title="Accessing uncontrolled state"
  demo={<DialogDemo.Close />}
  code={demos.close}
>
  To programmatically close an uncontrolled dialog, wrap the children into a
  function that receives a `close` function as a parameter. This function can be
  called to close the dialog.
</Demo>
