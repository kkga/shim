## What is this?

It's a collection of components built on top of
[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html). You
install the core dependencies and copy-paste (or download) the components you
need into your project. This way, you own the code and can customize it to your
liking.

## Why should I use it instead of x/y/z?

x/y/z are great, but there are a few reasons why you might want to use this:

- **React Aria:** It's built on top of React Aria, which is a set of
  high-quality components and hooks for building accessible UIs.
