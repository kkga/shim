## What is this?

It's a collection of components built on top of
[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html). You
install the core dependencies and copy-paste (or download) the components you
need into your project. This way, you own the code and can customize it to your
liking.

## Why should I use it instead of x/y/z?

x/y/z are great, but there are a few reasons why you might want to use this:

- **React Aria:** It's built on top of React Aria, which is a set of
  high-quality components and hooks for building accessible UIs.

## Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the components in your project. It
assumes you have a React project set up with TypeScript.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add React Aria Components">
    Install the core components using your package manager of choice.

    ```sh
    pnpm add react-aria-components
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tailwind CSS v4">

    <div>
    This project uses the alpha version of Tailwind CSS v4, which makes it much easier to customize without creating a config file.

    Refer to their alpha release [blog post](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#try-out-the-alpha) on how to install it in your project.
    </div>


    ```sh
    # using vite
    pnpm add tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next

    # using postcss
    pnpm add tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add dependencies">
  
  <div>
    [cva@beta](https://beta.cva.style/getting-started/installation) and [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) are used to generate style variants and work well with React Aria. 
    [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) and [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) are used in the components. Both are great.<br/>

    While it's possible to replace the icons and colors with other choices, it means that the components and the Tailwind theme will need to be updated to use the new icons and colors.

  </div>

```sh
pnpm add cva@beta\
  tailwind-merge\
  @phosphor-icons/react\
  @radix-ui/colors
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup styling utils">

    <div>
    Add the styling utilities into your project.

    A good place to put them is in a `lib/utils.ts` file, but
    you can customize the path alias to your preference at the last step.
    </div>

    <Pre collapsed code={utilsSource} />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup base CSS">

    <div>
    Add the base CSS with Tailwind imports, colors and semantic palette into your project.

    It can be a `base.css` or `theme.css` file, which needs to be imported in your app entry file.
    </div>


    <Pre collapsed code={baseCssSource} />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup path aliases">

    <div>
    Add the path aliases to your `tsconfig.json` file.

    This will allow you to import the components and utils with the `@ui/*` and `@lib/*` path aliases.

    If you prefer a different path, you can customize it here, but make sure to update the imports in the components.
    </div>


    ```ts
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "paths": {
          "@lib/utils": ["./lib/utils"], // path to the utils file
          "@ui/*": ["./components/ui/*"], // path to the components
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  </Step>

</Steps>
