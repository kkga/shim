## What is this

It's a collection of components built on top of
[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html). You
install the core dependencies and copy-paste (or download) the components you
need. This way, you own the code and can customize it to your liking.

## Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the components in your project. It
assumes you have a React project set up with TypeScript.

<Steps>

<Step>
  **Install React Aria Components** using your package manager of choice.
  <CodeBlock highlight={false} title="Terminal">
    pnpm add react-aria-components
  </CodeBlock>
</Step>

<Step>
  **Install Tailwind CSS v4 Beta.** Refer to the [v4
  docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta) on how to install it for your
  project.
</Step>

<Step>
  **Install styling dependencies and icons:**

- [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) works very well with
  React Aria Components;
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) and
  [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) are used for class
  merging;
- [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) for a balanced semantic
  palette and automatic dark mode;
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) are used within the components.
  They're great.

<CodeBlock highlight={false} title="Terminal">
  pnpm add tailwind-variants clsx tailwind-merge @radix-ui/colors @phosphor-icons/react
</CodeBlock>
</Step>

<Step>
**Add style and theme utilities.** The components use a few utility functions for styling and theming.
Copy-paste these into your project or download from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kkga/shim/tree/master/lib).
A good place to put these files might be `lib/style.ts` and `lib/theme.tsx`, but
the path alias can be customized (see the last step).

<CodeBlock title="style.ts" collapsed code={styleUtilsSrc} sourceUrl={styleUtilsUrl} />
<CodeBlock title="theme.tsx" collapsed code={themeUtilsSrc} sourceUrl={themeUtilsUrl} />
</Step>

<Step>
**Add theme CSS.** A single file containing [Tailwind v4 configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta#css-configuration-in-depth) and theme colors.
This file needs to be imported in your app entry file.

<CodeBlock title="theme.css" collapsed code={themeCssSrc} sourceUrl={themeCssUrl}/>
</Step>

<Step>
**Add path aliases** to TypeScript configuration.
This will allow importing components and utils with `@ui/*` and `@lib/*` aliases.
If you'll use different aliases, make sure to update the imports in components.

<CodeBlock title="tsconfig.json" code={`{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": "./",
      "paths": {
        "@ui/*": ["./components/ui/*"], // path to the components
        "@lib/*": ["./lib/*"], // path to the utilities (style.ts, theme.tsx)
      }
    }
  }`}/>
 </Step>

</Steps>
