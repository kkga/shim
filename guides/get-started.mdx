## What is this?

It's a collection of components built on top of
[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html). You
install the core dependencies and copy-paste (or download) the components you
need into your project. This way, you own the code and can customize it to your
liking.

---

## Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the components in your project. It
assumes you have a React project set up with TypeScript.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add React Aria Components">
    Install the core components using your package manager of choice.

    ```sh
    pnpm add react-aria-components
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tailwind CSS v4">

    <div>
    This project uses Tailwind CSS v4 Beta, which has some major changes from the previous version.

    Refer to the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta) on how to install it in your project.
    </div>


    ```sh
    # using vite
    pnpm add tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next

    # using postcss
    pnpm add tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add dependencies">
  
  <div>
    [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) is used for styling and its variant API works well with React Aria.
    
    [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) and [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) are small styling utilities that help with class names and merging Tailwind classes.

    [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) and [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) are used in the components.
    While the components are designed to work with these specific icons and colors, they can be replaced with other choices. See the [theming guide](/docs/guides/theming) for more details.

  </div>

```sh
pnpm add\
  tailwind-variants\
  clsx\
  tailwind-merge\
  @radix-ui/colors\
  @phosphor-icons/react
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup styling and theming utils">

    <div>
    The components use a few utility functions for styling and theming.
    You can copy-paste them into your project or download them from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kkga/shim/tree/master/lib).

    A good place to put these might be `lib/style.ts` and `lib/theme.tsx`, but
    you can customize the path alias to your preference at the last step.
    </div>

    <Pre className="row-start-1" title="style.ts" collapsed code={styleUtilsSource} />
    <Pre className="row-start-3!" title="theme.tsx" collapsed code={themeUtilsSource} />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup base CSS">

    <div>
    Add the base CSS with Tailwind imports, colors and semantic palette into your project.

    It can be a `base.css` or `theme.css` file, which needs to be imported in your app entry file.
    </div>


    <Pre title="base.css" collapsed code={themeCssSource} />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup path aliases">

    <div>
    Add the path aliases to your `tsconfig.json` file.

    This will allow you to import the components and utils with the `@ui/*` and `@lib/*` path aliases.

    If you prefer a different path, you can customize it here, but make sure to update the imports in the components.
    </div>


    ```ts
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "paths": {
          "@ui/*": ["./components/ui/*"], // path to the components
          "@lib/*": ["./lib/*"], // path to the utils file
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  </Step>

</Steps>
